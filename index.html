      My brothers and sisters, <br /><br />
      Every single one of us plays a role in this life. You are far more
      important than what you really think. Because every one of us is either
      a mother or a father or a neighbour or an employee or a worker. And
      somewhere out there there's a young boy or a young girl that's looking
      up to you. What seed are you planting in people's hearts. What vibes do
      you put out? And more importantly, how wil we be when we die? Will we be
      thanked? Or will we be forgotten? <br /><br />
      And lastly, <br /><br />
      Try to fix your salah. Try to fix your salah. If you're not praying,
      pray. If you're praying See how you can make it better. Ask the ones who
      are dead The one thing that you have now and they don't is your time.
      Take care of yourself and Take care of your soul. Jazakallahu khairan.
      <br />
      As salamu alaykum.
